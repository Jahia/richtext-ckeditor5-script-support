# RichText CKEditor5 Script Support

A Jahia `system` module that enables `<script>` tags in CKEditor 5 richtext fields. Useful for embedding third-party scripts (HubSpot forms, analytics snippets, etc.) directly in richtext content.

## Overview

By default, `<script>` tags are stripped at two independent layers:

| Layer | Problem | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| CKEditor 5 (client-side) | `DomConverter` blocks `<script>` in the editing DOM; `domToView` does not expose inline script bodies as view children | `ScriptElement` plugin with a data processor wrapper |
| Jahia `html-filtering` (server-side) | OWASP sanitizer strips `<script>` on save | Add `script` to the allowlist YAML |

Both layers must be configured for scripts to survive end-to-end.

## Installation

### 1. Deploy the module

```bash
mvn clean package
```

In Jahia, go to **Administration → Server → Modules & Extensions → Modules**, then upload `target/richtext-ckeditor5-script-support-*.jar`.

Since this is a `system` module, it is active on all sites automatically — no per-site activation needed.

### 2. Configure html-filtering

`org.jahia.modules.htmlfiltering.global.custom.yml` does not exist by default and **fully replaces** the default (no merge). Start by copying the default:

```bash
cp digital-factory-data/karaf/etc/org.jahia.modules.htmlfiltering.global.default.yml \
   digital-factory-data/karaf/etc/org.jahia.modules.htmlfiltering.global.custom.yml
```

In the copy, add the following entries in **both** `editWorkspace` and `liveWorkspace`, inside `allowedRuleSet.elements`, just before the `protocols` key:

```yaml
      # script tags
      - tags:
        - "script"
      - format: "LINKS_URL"
        attributes:
        - "src"
        tags:
        - "script"
      - attributes:
        - "type"
        - "async"
        - "defer"
        - "charset"
        - "crossorigin"
        - "integrity"
        - "referrerpolicy"
        - "nomodule"
        tags:
        - "script"
      protocols:   # <-- already present, insert above this line
```

Felix FileInstall picks up the change automatically — no restart needed.

### 3. Activate the CKEditor config

In `digital-factory-data/karaf/etc/org.jahia.modules.richtextCKEditor5.yaml`:

```yaml
configs:
  - name: completeWithScripts
```

Use `includeSites` / `excludeSites` to scope activation to specific sites.

## How it works

### Client-side

CKEditor 5 blocks `<script>` at two levels. First, `DomConverter` refuses to render script elements in the live editing DOM. Second, and more subtly, `domToView` (used during data load) does not expose the text content of `<script>` elements as child nodes in the view — so the standard upcast API sees an empty element regardless of the script body.

To work around this, the `ScriptElement` plugin wraps the data processor's `toView` method. Before CKEditor parses the HTML, any inline script body is base64-encoded into a temporary `data-cks-body` attribute. This turns content that CKEditor cannot see into an attribute it can.

The plugin then defines:

- **Upcast**: reads and decodes `data-cks-body`, stores the result in the `scriptPreserved` model element's `scriptContent` attribute. The model element is named `scriptPreserved` (not `htmlScript`) to avoid collision with `GeneralHtmlSupport`, which auto-generates model names using the `html` + PascalCase convention.
- **Editing downcast**: renders a styled `<div>` placeholder — a real `<script>` is never put into the editing DOM.
- **Data downcast**: restores the original `<script>` tag and its body using `createRawElement`, which is processed before DomConverter's security check and therefore goes through unblocked.

### Server-side

The `html-filtering` module uses OWASP Java HTML Sanitizer as a JCR interceptor: every richtext property is sanitized before being stored. Since `<script>` is not in the default allowlist, it must be added explicitly to the custom configuration as described above.

## Dependencies

- `richtext-ckeditor5` — provides the base `complete` CKEditor config that `completeWithScripts` extends
- `html-filtering` — must be configured as described in step 2
